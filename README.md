# my-portfolio
In my portfolio you can find a few words about me and my tech stack. I also present my experience and projects that I have worked on so far. Portfolio will certainly be expanded, because I'm still working on my own interesting projects :)
I used here Vue3, Typescript, Tailwind, i18n.
